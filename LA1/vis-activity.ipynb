    "\n",
    "1. Critical discussion of plot effectiveness in a given example\n",
    "2. Make a data story based on a given set of dashboards\n",
    "3. Create a new component of analysis and visualization to add to the data story\n",

    "After the lab, you will also get to review and provide feedback on the data story made by other participants.\n"
