"Calvert, Tom",In Memoriam,"My research focuses on computer based tools for user interaction with multimedia systems. This includes the use of networked multimedia for telelearning and systems for the choreography and animation of human figures., In collaboration with Dr. Linda Harasim of the SFU School of Communication and an interdisciplinary team, we have developed the web-based Virtual-U system for online collaborative learning. I have served as Co-leader of the TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence., My co-workers and I in the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab developed the Life Forms™ system for the choreography and animation of multiple human figures. The system was developed to support human figure animation, movement planning and the composition of dance. Life Forms has been instrumented and was used as a tool to study the creative processes involved in composition and animation. The research work was done in the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab at SFU. The Life Forms™ product was distributed in Windows'95, Macintosh and Silicon Graphics IRIS versions throughout the world.

"Asgari, Saeid",Adjunct Research Professor,"My research is around developing interpretable and trustworthy (robust, fair, and reliable) machine learning systems that can handle domain shifts and spurious correlations without significant failures. Lately, my work has been focused on foundation models and leveraging language models for interpreting various models, including those related to vision. I am also actively working on addressing copyright and parroting (memorization) issues in large generative models.",https://www.sfu.ca/fas/computing/people/faculty/adjunct-professors/saeid.html,https://asgsaeid.github.io
